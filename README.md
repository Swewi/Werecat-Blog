### This is Portfolio Project 4 for Full Stack Developer Diploma taught through Code Insititute.

## Purpose

The idea behind this website was to design a blog for a couple of crafty people that want to take things to the next level.

## Design

The client wanted a 'blog' so they could keep their community upto date with their project, any courses they may want to expand into, interesting events and information.  The second ask was for a 'contact form' so that people could contact them.  The third thing they wanted was an 'about me' page to introduce themselves to the world.  And finally they wanted a 'gallery' to show off.

They requested a vibrant cyberpunk colour scheme, when questioned about a preference for background image versus a solid colour, they said they had been playing with AI image generation and would love to have a background image using the colour scheme discused, and AI image generation.  We had a play with several generators while we were discussing things, and had a play with prompts.  After several tries we settled on this image:

The client loved it, and we were asked to proceed.

## UX - layout

### Home Page

This is the first page you see when opening the site, it has a responsive design so that it displays differently for different sized screens, the version shown here is for an ipad.
