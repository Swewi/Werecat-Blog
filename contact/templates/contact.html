        <h2>We love crafting!</h2>
        <p>Have you seen anything on this blog that takes your fancy? Maybe you have got inspiration from a website
            and need help? Ask us!</p>
        <br>
        <p>One of our members specialises in knitted socks and items, textiles, and small woodworking projects. The
            other member specialises in paracord projects, rope both new and upcycled, and chainmail.</p>
        <p>Both of us make historically inspired items. We n√•lbind (needle-binding), a type of yarn work
            that predates knitting or crochet. We have been known to hand stitch hats, bags, and pouches, and even
            tunics and dresses!</p>
