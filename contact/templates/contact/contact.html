            <p>One of our members specialises in knitted socks and items, textiles, and small woodworking projects. The

            <p>Both of us make historically inspired items. We n√•lbind (needle-binding), a type of yarn work
                that predates knitting or crochet. We have been known to hand stitch hats, bags, and pouches, and even
                tunics and dresses!</p>
